* [Most of lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

* 1.Applicant whose annual Income range 0-20000 has high chances of charged off. Notice that with increase in annual income 
charged off proportion got decreased.
2. loan amount 0-7000 has less chances of charged off. loan amount 280000+ has high chances of charged off. Notice that with 
increase in loan amount charged off proportion got increased.

charged off proportion got increased.

the year 2011 and 2008.
7. Those who already have pub_rec_bankruptcies value 2, have charged off proportion higher than who have no 
pub_rec_bankruptcies.
Not known is the column for which we don't have any information about borrower.This also makes sense that who has defaulted 
before has chances of dafaulting in future as well.

9. Employee experience of 10 years has less chances of charged off. No Employee experience has high chances of charged off.
10. Loan which is taken for small business has more chances of charged off. Loan which is taken for wedding,credit_card and car 
has less chances of charged off.
11. Grade G has more chances of charged off. Grade A has less chances of charged off. charged off inceases as grade moves

## General Information
- Most of lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- Lending club website
